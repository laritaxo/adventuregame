You are sitting on a bench at the tram station at Potsdam Central Station. 
You look at the timetable and see that your tram will arrive in 7 minutes. 
You close your eyes and feel the sunlight on your face.
When suddenlyâ€¦
You remember that you forgot that you didn't got the book from the library after your course. 
You need the book to study for next weeks exam.
Do you want to hurry and go get the next train to Golm before the library closes?
